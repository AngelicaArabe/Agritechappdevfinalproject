# AgriTech AquaSync: Smart Irrigation for Sustainable Tomato Growth
 The "AgriTech AquaSync: Smart Irrigation for Sustainable Tomato Growth" project aims to improve irrigation methods and environmental conditions on JSAP Farm by using IoT devices for monitoring and control. The application is accessible through any mobile devices and uses technical terms such as DHT22, Flutter, and Dart. Flutter enhances content presentation, Dart adds dynamism, and DHT22 sensor measures temperature and humidity in tomato farm environments, allowing app accessibility for farmers.
     The project aims to enhance water use in agriculture, particularly tomato crops, through smart irrigation systems, thereby reducing water waste and promoting sustainable water resource utilization by focusing on SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. 

 # Features
